"""Runs edk2toolext's fpdt_parser on a captured FBPT binary from any platform.

fpdt_parser can read the live FPDT out of the running Windows system, so it
imports ``windll``/``WinError`` at module scope and constructs its Windows
firmware-table accessor unconditionally in ``main``. Parsing a binary captured
elsewhere (``-b``) never uses that accessor -- every call site is guarded on
``input_fbpt_bin is None`` -- but the import and the construction still fail on
a non-Windows host.

This wrapper supplies the missing ctypes names and replaces the accessor with a
stand-in, so the same parser can run in CI on Linux. Any code path that does
reach the Windows API raises rather than silently misbehaving.
