"""Prints ms-resolution boot milestones from a parsed FBPT XML report.

The capture harness is expected to report a boot time for each QEMU
invocation, so every run prints a short summary instead of leaving the numbers
to manual post-processing of the generated reports.

Only the ACPI-defined basic boot performance record is summarised here. The
parser also emits per-phase records, but their reported millisecond values are
not all on one time base in this firmware -- PEI end, for example, comes out as
264303577 ms, roughly 73 hours -- so folding them into a summary would report
figures that look authoritative and are not. Per-phase detail remains available
in the generated text and XML reports for anyone who needs it.
